Application to read Lunii (registered trademark) stories from the SDCard. Built for people which have a broken device who still want a way to keep listening to the stories they bought. Open the device with a Torx 6 screwdriver, take out the SDCard, insert the SDCard in an Android phone or tablet, and launch the application. Note that if your device is less than two years old, it's still under warranty, so you'd better contact customer service who will send you a new device if the damage is covered by clauses.
