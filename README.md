CONTEXT
-------

I've done if after the genuine device got broken after the guarantee period and too difficult to fix.
Indeed, I've fixed it 3 times, but don't manage to fix it one more time.
The V2 of device is too weak for our usage, so buying a new one was not an option until a stronger 
version is released.
This is a way to don't loose the stories I've bought.
I published it so that other people with a broken device can still listen to the stories they've bought.
