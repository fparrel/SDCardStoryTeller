# SDCard StoryTeller
====================
This software allows to read Lunii StoryTeller content from an SDCard inserted in an Android Tablet 
or Phone.
I've done if after the genuine device got broken after the guarantee period and too difficult to fix.
Indeed, I've fixed it 3 times, but don't manage to fix it one more time.
The V2 of device is too weak for our usage, so buying a new one was not an option until a stronger 
version is released.
This is a way to don't loose the stories I've bought.
I published it so that other people with a broken device can still listen to the stories they've bought.
